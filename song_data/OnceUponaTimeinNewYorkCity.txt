Now it's always once upon a time, in New York City It's a big old, bad old, tough old town, it's true But beginnings are contagious there They're always setting stages there They're always turning pages there for you Ain't it great the way it all begins in New York City Right away, you're making time, and making friends No one cares where you were yesterday If they pick you out, you're on your way To a once upon a time that never ends So Oliver, don't be shy Get out there and go and try Believin' that you're the guy They're dying to see 'Cause a dream's no crime Not once upon a time Once upon a time in New York City If it's always once upon a time in New York City Why does nightfall leave you feeling so alone How could any one stay starry-eyed When it's raining cats and dogs outside And the rain has said "now you're on your own" So Oliver don't be scared Though yesterday no one cared They're getting your place prepared Where you want to be Keep your dream alive Dreaming is still how the strong survive Once upon a time in New York City Keep your dream alive Dreaming is still how the strong survive Once upon a time in New York City Keep your dream alive Dreaming is still how the strong survive Once upon a time in New York City And it's always once upon a time, in New York City
