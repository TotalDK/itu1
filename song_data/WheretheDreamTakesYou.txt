They'll try to hold you back They will say your wrong But they will never understand The journey that your on They'll try to change your mind They'll try to change your heart But they will never understand Who you are And you'll still believe And you know, you must go Where the dream takes you Where your dream takes your heart Where your heart longs to be Your dream will lead your on When you finally find that place You'll find all you need Where the dream takes you There's something in your soul That won't be denied It's the faith to dream that keeps The dream alive So you'll still believe And you know, you must go Where the dream takes you Where your dream takes your heart Where your heart longs to be Your dream will lead you on When you finally find that place You'll find all you need Where the dream takes you… Go where your heart is meant to be And you may find somebody there So won't you share your dream? Where your dream takes your heart Your dream will lead you on When you finally find that place You'll find all you need Where the dream leads you Your dream will lead you home Where your eyes can see Your dream will lead you on There's a world that waits for you Can neither hold You'll find your home Where the dream takes you They'll try to change your mind Where the dream takes you They'll try to change your heart Where the dream takes you But you must go Where the dream takes you
