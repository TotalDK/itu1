Les poissons, les poissons How I love les poissons Love to chop and to serve little fish First I cut off their heads Then I pull out their bones Ah mais oui, ça c'est toujours delice Les poissons, les poissons Hee hee hee, haw haw haw With a cleaver I hack them in two I pull out what's inside And I serve it up fried God, I love little fishes, don't you? Here's something for tempting the palette Prepared in the classic technique First you pound the fish flat with a mallet Then you slash off their skin Give their belly a slice Then you rub some salt in 'Cause it makes it taste nice Zut alors, I have missed one! Sacre bleu, what is this? How on earth could I miss Such a sweet little succulent crab Quel dommage, what a loss Here we go, in the sauce Now some flour I think just a dab Now I stuff you with bread Don't worry, 'cause you're dead And you're certainly lucky you are 'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot Toodle-oo mon poisson Au revoir!
