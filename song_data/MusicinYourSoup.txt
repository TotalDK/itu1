With a spoon and a bowl With the music in your soul You can cheer things up with the zub, zub, zub Of the music in your soup With a gulp With a grin Get a wiggle on your chin You can make things hum with a zum, zum, zum Of the music in your soup Swing that spoon Gota keep on dippin' Scoop up that soup Gotta keep on sippin' Till the bowl is dry And your face is drippin' Let her rip! Let her roar! To the first and the second And the third encore
