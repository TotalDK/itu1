So many times out there I've watched a happy pair Of lovers walking in the night They had a kind of glow around them It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know That warm and loving glow Though I might wish with all my might No face as hideous as my face Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she Might even care for me And as I ring these bells tonight My cold dark tower seems so bright I swear it must be heaven's light Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti Beatae Mariae semper Virgini Beato Michaeli archangelo Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis Beata Maria You know I am a righteous man Of my virtue I am justly proud (Et tibit Pater) Beata Maria You know I'm so much purer than The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd (Quia peccavi nimis) Then tell me, Maria Why I see her dancing there Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul (Cogitatione) I feel her, I see her The sun caught in her raven hair Is blazing in me out of all control (Verbo et opere) Like fire Hellfire This fire in my skin This burning Desire Is turning me to sin It's not my fault (Mea culpa ) I'm not to blame (Mea culpa) It is the gypsy girl The witch who sent this flame (Mea maxima culpa) It's not my fault (Mea culpa) If in God's plan (Mea culpa) He made the devil so much Stronger than a man (Mea maxima culpa) Protect me, Maria Don't let this siren cast her spell Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone Destroy Esmeralda And let her taste the fires of hell Or else let her be mine and mine alone Hellfire Dark fire Now gypsy, it's your turn Choose me or Your pyre Be mine or you will burn (Kyrie Eleison) God have mercy on her (Kyrie Eleison) God have mercy on me (Kyrie Eleison) But she will be mine or She will burn
