Yodel-ay-ee-hoo (etc.) (Chorus) You're never too old to be young You're never too old to be young When you start to lose your figure And your hips are gettin' bigger Your chest may slip But don't you fret No matter how weak your knees may get You're never too old to be young You're never too old to be young When you start to lose your figure And your hips are gettin' bigger Your chest may slip But don't you fret No matter how weak your knees may get Though your teeth are out And your whiskers sprout And your arches give away You're never too old to be young and gay When ya ain't got any fuzz upon your dome When ya ain't got any fuzz upon your dome Why the dickens should you care If you ain't got any hair 'Cause you never have to use a brush and comb When you know your legs are gonna give out soon When you know your legs are gonna give out soon When your joints begin to squeak If you practice for a week You can walk around and play yourself a tune Your voice may crack when you try to sing But you can't be good at everything You're never too old to be young You're never too old to be young When you start to lose your figure And your hips are gettin' bigger Your chest may slip But don't you fret No matter how weak your knees may get
