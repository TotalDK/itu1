Don't matter what you look like Don't matter what you wear How many rings you got on your finger We don't care, no, we don't care Don't matter where you come from Don't even matter what you are A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat Got em' all in here, we got em' all in here If they all knew what they wanted What they wanted, need to do I told 'em what they needed Just like I be telling you You gotta dig a little deeper Find out who you are You gotta dig a little deeper It really ain't that far When you found out who you are You find out what you need Blue skies and sun shine Guaranteed You gotta dig, dig You gotta dig, dig Prince Froggy is a rich little boy You wanna be rich again That ain't gonna make you happy now Did it make you happy then? No Money ain't got no soul Money ain't got no heart All you need is some self-control Make yourself a brand new start You gotta dig a little deeper Don't have far to go You gotta dig a little deeper Tell the people Mama told you so Can't tell you what you'll find Maybe love or grant you a piece of mind Dig a little deeper and you'll know Miss Froggy, might I have a word? You's a hard one, that's what I heard Your daddy was a loving man Family through and through You your daddy's daughter What he had in him you got in you You gotta dig a little deeper For you it's gonna be tough You gotta dig a little deeper You ain't dug this far enough Dig down deep inside yourself You'll found out what you need Blue skies and sunshine Guaranteed Open up the window Let in the light, dearie Blue skies and sunshine Blue skies and sunshine Blue skies and sunshine Guaranteed
