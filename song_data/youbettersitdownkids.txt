You better sit down kids, I'll tell you why, kids You might not understand, kids, But give it a try, kids Now how should I put this, I've got something to say Your mama is staying, But I'm goin' away No, we're not mad, kids, And it's hard to say why Your mother and I, kids, Don't see eye to eye Say your prayers before you go to bed Make sure you get yourself to school on time I know you'll do the things your mother asks She's gonna need you most to stay in line Keep in mind your mama's gonna need Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before No more fightin' over little things 'cause I won't be here to stop them anymore I know you don't want this, But neither do we But sometimes things happen, That we can't foresee So try to be calm, kids, And don't look so sad Just cause I am leavin', I'll still be your dad But just remember I love you, And though I'm not here Just call if you need me, I'll always be near Say your prayers before you go to bed Make sure you get yourself to school on time I know you'll do the things your mother asks She's gonna need you most to stay in line Keep in mind your mother's gonna need Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before No more fightin' over little things 'cause I won't be here to stop them anymore Well, I have to go now, So kiss me goodbye My eyes are just red, kids, I'm too big to cry
