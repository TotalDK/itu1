La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out Sometimes the love that you wasted Becomes the love that you’ve lost A moment feels like a lifetime Cry, cry, cry you can’t stop Just when I feel no ignition No one but me understands Arms reach out from a distance Palm to palm, touching hands Oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out Oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out You know that you are a fighter But you feel yourself fall apart Now you’re just panicking because you’re left defeated And you’ve seen nothing but dark But when my soul is in pieces No one but me understands Arms reach out from a distance Palm to palm, touching hands Oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out Oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Cause oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out Oh feels like you light me up Feels like you light me up When the sparks run out La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
