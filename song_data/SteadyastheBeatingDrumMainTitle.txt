Hega hega yah-pi-ye-hega Yah-pi-ye-he-he hega Hega hega yah-pi-ye-hega Yah-pi-ye-he-he hega Steady as the beating drum Singing to the cedar flute Seasons Go and seasons Come Bring the corn and bear the fruit By the waters sweet and clean Where the mighty sturgeon lives Plant the squash and reap the bean All the earth our mother gives O Great Spirit, hear our song Help us keep the ancient ways Keep the sacred fire strong Walk in balance all our days Seasons go and seasons come Steady as the beating drum Plum to seed to bud to plum (Hega hega yah-pi-ye hega) Steady as the beating drum Hega hega yam-pi-ye-hega Yah-pi-ye-ne-he hega Hega hega yam-pi-ye-hega Yah-pi-ye-ne-he hega
