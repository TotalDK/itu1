For now and always I'll hold you tight, day and night Keep the love light burnin' bright in my heart for you Pretty little sweetheart I'll love you for now and always I'll break a date to roller skate To set up late just to wait at the gate for you Pretty little sweetheart I'll love you for now and always Can't you see you'll always be the one for me 'Cause I'll always be in love with you Pretty little sweetheart I'll love you for now and always I'll do the chores, I'll sweep the floors I'll run the stores, 'cause I'll always adore you Love is like a roller coaster Riding up and down Gonna make a great big coaster Spread the news around Pretty little sweetheart I'll love you for now and always I can't deny my heart will fly Up to the sky when I sing a lullaby to you Pretty little sweetheart I'll love you for now and always I'll do my work like a Turk I'll never shirk, I'll be a butcher boy or clerk for you Not for a day, not for a year Not for a century, but forever dear For now and always Just for your sake the time I'll take A pretty bungalow I'll even learn to make for you Pretty little sweetheart I'll love you for now and always Then there'll be three, you and me And someone sweet as she can be who looks just like you Pretty little sweetheart, pretty little sweetheart Pretty little sweetheart, I love you
