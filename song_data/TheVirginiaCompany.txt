In sixteen hundred seven We sail the open sea For glory, God, and gold And The Virginia Company For the New World is like heaven And we'll all be rich and free Or so we have been told By The Virginia Company For glory, God and gold And The Virginia Company On the beaches of Virginny There's diamonds like debris There's silver rivers flow And gold you pick right off a tree With a nugget for my Winnie And another one for me And all the rest'll go To The Virginia Company It's glory, God and gold And The Virginia Company
