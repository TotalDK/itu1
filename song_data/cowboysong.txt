This morning I woke up alone I spent the day time on my own Lots of people have come and gone To hear a cowboy sing an old time song Oh babe, I love you so This here is the only thing I know It ain't right and it ain't wrong To hear a cowboy sing an old time song Last night I sat 'till closing time Thinking of the things that crossed my mind You were the one I was thinking of I guess it must be that I'm just in love I hope they play this song of mine On the jukebox for a dime Then if you leave 'cause something's wrong You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song
