What can you expect From filthy little heathens? Their whole disgusting race is like a curse Their skin's a hellish red They're only good when dead They're vermin, as I said And worse They're savages! Savages! Barely even human Savages! Savages! Drive them from our shore! They're not like you and me Which means they must be evil We must sound the drums of war! They're savages! Savages! Dirty redskin devils! Now we sound the drums of war! This is what we feared The paleface is a demon The only thing they feel at all is greed Beneath that milky hide There's emptiness inside I wonder if they even bleed They're savages! Savages! Barely even human Savages! Savages! Killers at the core They're different from us Which means they can't be trusted We must sound the drums of war They're savages! Savages! First we deal with this one Then we sound the drums of war Savages! Savages! Let's go kill a few, men! Savages! Savages! Now it's up to you, men! Savages! Savages! Barely even human! Now we sound the drums of war!
