Gonna shout it from the mountaintops A star is born It's a time for pulling out the stops A star is born Honey, hit us with a hallelu' The kid came shining through Girl, sing the song Come blow your horn A star is born He's a hero who can please the crowd A star is born Come on everybody shout out loud A star is born Just remember in the darkest hour Within your heart's the power For making you A hero too So don't lose hope when you're forlorn Just keep your eyes upon the skies Every night a star is Right in sight a star is Burning bright a star is born Like a beacon in the cold dark night A star is born Told ya everything would turn out right A star is born Just when everything was all at sea The boy made history The bottom line He sure can shine His rising sign is Capricorn He knew "how to" He had a clue Telling you a star is born Here's a hero who can please the crowd A star is born Come on everybody shout out loud A star is born Just remember in the darkest hour Within your heart's the power For making you A hero too So don't lose hope when you're forlorn Just keep your eyes upon the skies Every night a star is Right in sight a star is Burning bright a star is born
