Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! We work all day, we work all night We never learned to read or write We're happy-hearted roustabouts Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! When other folks have gone to bed We slave until we're almost dead We're happy-hearted roustabouts Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! We don't know when we get our pay And when we do, we throw our pay away We get our pay when children say With happy hearts, "It's circus day today" Muscles achin' Back near breaking Eggs and bacon what we need (Yes, sir!) Boss man houndin' Keep on poundin' For your bed and feed There ain't no let up Must get set up Pull that canvas! Drive that stake! Want to doze off Get them clothes off But must keep awake Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Swing that sledge! Sing that song! Work and laugh the whole night long You happy-hearted roustabouts! Pullin', poundin', tryin', groundin' Big top roundin' into shape Keep on working! Stop that shirking! Grab that rope, you hairy ape! Poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! Oh
