One two, a one two three four I don't believe in frettin' or grievin' Why mess around with strife? Guess I was cut out to step up and strut out Give me the simple life It must be pleasant dining on pheasant Using the proper knife I want tomatoes and mashed potatoes Give me the simple life Cottage small is all I'm after Not one that's spacious and wide Ah, that brings the joy and laughter With the ones that you love inside You take the high road, I'll take the low road Free from all care and strife Sounds corny and seedy, oh yes, indeed Give me the simple life A cottage small is all I'm after Not one that's spacious and wide A house that brings the joy and laughter With the ones that you love inside You take the high road, I'll take the low road Free from all care and strife Sounds corny and seedy, oh yes, indeed Give me the simple life, give me the simple life
