Maybe you've heard of a terrible place Where the scoundrels of Paris Collect in a lair Maybe you've heard of that mythical place Called the Court of Miracles Hello, you're there! Where the lame can walk And the blind can see But the dead don't talk So you won't be around To reveal what you've found We have a method for spies and intruders Rather like hornets protecting their hive Here in the Court of Miracles Where it's a miracle if you get out alive! Justice is swift in the Court of Miracles I am the lawyers and judge all in one We like to get the trial over with quickly Because it's the sentence that's really the fun! Now that we've seen all the evidence Wait! I object! Overruled! I object! Quiet! Dang! We find you totally innocent Which is the worst crime of all So you're going to hang!
