You don't have to protect me I'm not afraid Please don't shut me out again, Please don't slam the door You don't have to keep your distance anymore 'Cause for the first time in forever, I finally understand For the first time in forever, We can fix this hand in hand We can head down this mountain together! You don't have to live in fear... 'Cause for the first time in forever I will be right here Anna Please go back home Your life awaits Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates Yeah, but I know! You mean well, but leave me be Yes, I'm alone but I'm alone and free! Just stay away and you'll be safe from me Actually we're not What do you mean you're not? I get the feeling you don't know What do I not know? Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep, deep... Snow What? You've kind of set off an eternal winter... Everywhere Everywhere? It's okay, you can just unfreeze it. No, I can't I, I don't know how! Sure you can! I know you can! 'Cause for the first time in forever, I'm such a fool! I can't be free! You don't have to be afraid... No escape from the storm inside of me! We can work this out together! I can't control the curse! We'll reverse the storm you've made Anna, please, you'll only make it worse! Don't panic! There's so much fear! We'll make the sun shine bright! You're not safe here! We can face this thing together! No! We can change this winter weather! Ahhh... And everything will be all right... I can't!
