The way I feel is the way I am I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you Just to you What kind of people do you think we are? Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you Just for you The hateful image of another man The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you Yeah for you The shock troopers laying down on the floor I wish they’d fallen into my private war with you Yeah with you Are you devil, are you man You’ve changed a lot since you began Yeah began Ladies digging gold from you Will they still dig now you're through Yeah you're through You bought and sold me with your lying words The voices in the dark that you never heard came true Yeah came true Your fallen phallic god dismembered and gone A poison father with his poisonous son, that’s you Yeah that's you I beg you please don't let it get any worse The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you Yeah curse you All of the promises that never came true You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true Ah, that's true Are you Satan, are you man? You've changed a lot since it began It began Vultures sucking gold from you Will they still suck now you're through Cats, rats The search is on, so you just better run And find yourself another way Rob the dead, they don't feel a thing Leave the living for another day Rats, rats You are nonentity, you have no destiny You are a figment of a thing unknown A mental picture of a stolen soul The fornication of your golden throne A smiling face, it means the world to me So tired of sadness and of misery My life it started some time ago Where it will end, I don't know I thought I was so good I thought I was smart I feel my world is torn apart But everything is gonna work out fine If it don't I think I'll lose my mind I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know Listen to me while I sing this song You might just think the words are wrong Too many people advising me But they don't know what my eyes see But everything is gonna work out fine If it don't I feel I'll blow my mind
