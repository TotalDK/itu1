When I sleep I slide into Some heaven But no one is there. If I believed, If I should wonder, If I forgive Then would you come for me? When I sleep I hear sad words Songs of God That show me the lie. 'I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you warm and I'll keep you here, Alone forever.' And I believe in faith and magic. And I believe in love and wonder. And I'll believe in you when you come for me. And I'll believe in you when the world comes apart.
