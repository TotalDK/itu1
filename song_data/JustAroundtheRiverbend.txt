What I love most about rivers is You can't step in the same river twice The water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that We all must pay a price To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free Don't know what for what I dream the day might send Just around the river bend for me, coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees Or right behind these waterfalls Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend Just around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum? Is all my dreaming at an end? Or do you still wait for me, dream giver Just around the river bend?
