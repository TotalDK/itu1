Moving down the water John is drifting out of sight, It's only at the turning point That you find out how to fight. In the cold, feel the cold all around And the rush of crashing water Surround me with its sound. Striking out to reach you, I can't get through to the other side. When you're racing in the rapids There's only one way, that's to ride. Taken down, taken down by the undertow And I'm spiralled down the river bed, My fire is burning low. Catching hold of a rock that's firm, I'm waiting for John to be carried past. We hold together and shoot the rapids fast. And when the waters slow down The dark and the deep have no-one left to keep. Hang on John! We're out of this at last. Something's changed, that's not your face. It's mine!
