Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said "no thanks!" We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch Not everyone invited will be coming back from lunch This is the morning report Gives you the long and the short Every grunt, roar, and snort Not a tale I distort On the morning report The buffalo have got a beef About this season's grass Warthogs have been thwarted In attempts to save their gas Flamingoes in the pink and Chasing secretary birds Saffron is this season's color Seen in all the herds Moving down the rank and file To near the bottom rung Far too many beetles are Quite frankly in the dung Aak! This is the morning report Gives you the long and the short Every grunt, roar, and snort Not a tale I distort On the morning report This is the morning report Gives you the long and the short Every grunt, roar, and snort Not a tale I distort On the morning report
