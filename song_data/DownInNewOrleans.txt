In the south land There's a city Way down on the river Where the women are very pretty And all the men deliver We got music It's always playin Start in the day time And go all through the night And when you hear that music playing Hear what I'm sayin Make you feel alright Grab somebody Come on down Bring a paint brush We're painting the town There's some sweetness goin around Dreams do come true in new Orleans
