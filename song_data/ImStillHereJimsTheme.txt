I am a question to the world not and answer to be Heard or a moment that's held in your arms and what do you think you'd ever say I won't listen anyway you don't know me and I'll never be what you want me to be and what do you think you'd understand I'm a boy no, I'm a man You can't take me and throw me away And how can you learn what's never shown Yeah you stand here on your own They don't know me Cause I'm not here And I want a moment to be real Wanna touch things I don't feel We want to hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change They're the ones that stay the same They don't know me Cause I'm not here And you see the things they never see All you wanted I could be Now you know me and I'm not afraid And I wanna tell you who I am Can you help me be a man They can't break me As long as I know who I am They can't see me But I'm still here They can't tell me who to be Cause I'm not what they see Yeah, the world is still sleeping While I keep on dreaming for me And their words are just whispers and lies That I'll never believe And I want a moment to be real Wanna touch things I don't feel We want to hold on and feel I belong And how can they say I'll never change They're the ones that stay the same I'm the one now Cause I'm still here I'm the one Cause I'm still here I'm still here I'm still here I'm still here
