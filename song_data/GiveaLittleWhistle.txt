When you get in trouble And you don't know right from wrong Give a little whistle, give a little whistle When you meet temptation And the urge is very strong Give a little whistle, give a little whistle Not just a little squeak, pucker up and blow And if you're whistle is weak, yell Jiminy Cricket Right Take the strait and narrow path And if you start to slide Give a little whistle, give a little whistle And always let your conscience be your guide Take the strait and narrow path And if you start to slide Give a little whistle (yoo-hoo) Give a little whistle (yoo-hoo) And always let your conscience be your guide And always let your conscience be your guide
