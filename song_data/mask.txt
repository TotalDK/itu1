You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask You look better that way You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask You look better that way Are you my friend? Are you my plumber? Are you my God? What do you do? Wearing a mask You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask Which mask are you? Which mask are you? Complicated, crushed up, disappointed Squirming, angry, thrusting, stabbing, regretting, starving Greedy human alien being, struggling down the street Up the alley, in the elevator, through the party To the office, in the bedroom, on your way to the morgue Bullshitting, lying, doing a good deed or feeling loved barely possible Aware of insatiable demands of not a society all around you Chunky frat boys in their shorts, pimps with old Semite eyes Sex hoochies of the jungle, sensitive smart Alec college graduates Critics fronting franticly in New York city, every body in L.A. Just plain licking ass or having it licked Irony in place of balls, balls in place of brains Brains in place of soul, where is the soul? Where is the love, where am I? Which mask are you? Which mask are you? Which mask are you? You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask You're wearing a mask Which mask are you?
