I don't believe in miracles I don't believe in forgiving I don't believe in I can go on I won't remember why I don't believe in long goodbyes Never look back for me It's over And everything has gone And everything has gone away I don't remember the faces I don't remember the feelings I don't remember your stories I won't remember you I don't remember our secrets My God just look at me
