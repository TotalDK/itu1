I don't care who's watching Don't mind what the surfing heads might say Although I may not be no Charlie Atlas I'm gonna take my shirt off anyway Now skin and bones sinks easy on the high tide And I'm not one for castles in the sand I've seen a girl I once knew from the East Side I think I spy a bottle in her hand I think I spy a bottle in her hand I don't need to know your birthday 'Cause what you tell her I don't claim to be There's a place I know of called the Tip Top Won't you come and take a walk with me Won't you come and take a walk with me Didn't take too much hard work to get her Melted like a chocolate in my arms If had ever seen it better It never did the scenery no harm Never did the scenery no harm.
