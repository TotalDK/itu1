Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete It seems I couldn't help but think that love was not for me My life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldn't resist I didn't know why I have missed and I'm gettin' happy oh I'm gettin' happy Yeah yaeh I'm a gettin' happy all my lonely days're gone I'm a gettin' happy no more lonely nights alone I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song And he lets me sing along I'm gettin' happy oh I'm gettin' happy Oh the people used to talk of love and I couldn't understand About the fire in desire of lovin' a good man Oh but now I know just what it meant since I met me a man who was heaven's sent Don't know where the sadness went I'm gettin' happy oh I'm gettin' happy I'm a gettin' happy... Yeah I'm a gettin' happy... Yeah I'm a gettin' happy...
