This is the time This is the vibe Don't you want to get onto the ride Come on inside From the outside The truth will set you free and you will find That there is a love That won't let you down And it always holds ground Wear your crown This love will never leave you This love will never let you go It is time for a love revolution It is time for a new constitution You are a child of the most high There's nothing you can't do and that's no lie You were designed to use your mind To move what you can't see so don't be blind 'Cause there is a love That won't let you down and it always holds ground Wear your crown This love will never leave you This love will never let you go It is time for a love revolution It is time, it is time, for a new constitution It is time, it is time, for a love revolution Love revolution It is time, it is time, for a new constitution It is time, it is time, for a love revolution A love revolution It is time, it is time, for a new constitution It is time, it is time, for a love revolution A love revolution It is time, it is time, for a new constitution
