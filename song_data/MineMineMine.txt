The gold of Cortés The jewels of Pizarro Will seem like mere trinkets By this time tomorrow The gold we find here Will dwarf them by far Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys Dig up Virginia, boys Mine, boys, mine ev'ry mountain And dig, boys, dig 'til ya drop Grab a pick, boys Quick, boys Shove in a shovel Uncover those lovely Pebbles that sparkle and shine It's gold and it's mine, mine, mine Dig and dig and dig and diggety Dig and dig and dig and diggety Hey nonny nonny Oh, how I love it! Hey nonny nonny Riches for Cheap! Hey nonny nonny There'll be heaps of it And I'll be on top of the heap! My rivals back home It's not that I'm bitter But think how they'll squirm When they see how I glitter! The ladies at court The king will reward me He'll knight me, no, lord me! It's mine, mine, mind For the taking It's mine, boys Mine me that gold! With those nuggets dug It's glory they'll gimme My dear friend, King Jimmy Will probably build me a shrine When all of the gold is mine Dig and dig and dig and diggety Dig and dig and dig and diggety-dig! All of my life, I have searched for a land Like this one A wilder, more challenging country I couldn't design Hundreds of dangers await And I don't plan to miss one In a land I can claim A land I can tame The greatest adventure is mine! Keep on working, lands Don't be shirking, lands Mine, boys, mind Mine me that gold Beautiful gold Make this island My land! Make the mounds big, boys I'd help you to dig, boys But I've got this crick in me spine This land we behold This beauty untold A man can be bold! It all can be sold! And the gold Is Mine! Mine! Mine!
