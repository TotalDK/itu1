Ocean of motion Squirming around and up and down Pushing together Scattering mountains all around you That is the sound of a new born world And the light from a curious sky It has begun You're in the hands of destiny Thrashing with violence Hurling its lava up and down Furnace of frenzy Burning with power uncontrolled That is the sound of a new born world And the light from a curious sky It has begun You're in the hands of destiny Is that the chariot with stallions gold? Is that a prince of heaven on the ground? Is that the roar of a thundercrash? This is my world and it's waiting to be crowned Father, son, looks down with happiness Life is on its way Ocean of motion Squirming around and up and down Pushing together Scattering mountains all around you That is the sound of a new born world And the light from a curious sky It has begun You're in the hands of destiny Is that the chariot with stallions gold? Is that a prince of heaven on the ground? Is that the roar of a thundercrash? This is my world and it's waiting to be crowned Father, son, looks down with happiness Life is on its way
