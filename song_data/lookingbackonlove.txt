Looking back on love through a broken old TV Looking back on love but it's kind of hard to see I'm just trying to find the place where I should be Looking back on love, oh yeah Looking back on love though the players have all changed Looking back on love even though we're all estranged Now what can we do with the feelings we've exchanged Oh, oh yeah, looking back on love Looking back on love in the paintings on the wall Looking back on love it is cracked and about to fall I should be running like a baby I still crawl, oh yeah Looking back on love, oh Looking back on love like a rerun in my mind Looking back on love but it seems as if I'm blind Holding memories like the sun that always shine Now I need to find a love I can call mine Oh, oh, looking back on love Yeah Looking back Looking back on love Looking back on love, wonder if I will survive Looking back on love, it is time for me to dive Once I go beneath will I finally be alive Looking back on love Looking back on love
