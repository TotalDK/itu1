Baby, I knew at once that You were meant for me Deep in my soul I know That I'm your destiny Though you're unsure Why fight the tide Don't think so much Let your heart decide Baby, I see your future And it's tied to mine I look in your eyes and see You searching for a sign But you'll never fall Till you let go Don't be scared Of what you don't know True to your heart You must be True to your heart That's when the Heavens will part And baby, shower you With my love Open your eyes Your heart can tell You no lies And when you're true To your heart I know it's gonna lead You straight to me (Got to be true To your heart) Someone ya know is on Your side, can set you free I can do that for you if You believe in me Why second-guess What feels so right Just trust your heart And you'll see the light True to your heart You must be True to your heart That's when the Heavens will part And baby, shower you With my love Open your eyes Your heart can tell You no lies And when you're true To your heart I know it's gonna lead You straight to me (Ya know it's true) Your heart knows What's good for you (Good for you) Let your heart show You the way (Ya know it's true) It'll see you through (Got to be true To your heart) Girl, my heart is driving Me to where you are You can take both hands off The wheel and still get far Be swept away Enjoy the ride You won't get lost With your heart to guide you True to your heart You must be True to your heart That's when the Heavens will part And baby, shower you With my love Open your eyes Your heart can tell You no lies And when you're true To your heart I know it's gonna lead You straight to me (Got to be true To your heart) True to your heart You must be True to your heart That's when the Heavens will part And baby, shower you With my love Open your eyes Your heart can tell You no lies And when you're true To your heart I know it's gonna lead You straight to me (Got to be true To your heart) When things are gettin' crazy And you don't know Where to start Keep on believin', baby Just be true to your heart When all the world around you It seems to fall apart Keep on believin', baby Just be true to your heart Play Music
