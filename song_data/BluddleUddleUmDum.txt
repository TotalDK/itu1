Doc: Step up to the tub It ain't no disgrace Just pull up your sleeves And get 'em in place Then scoop up the water And rub it on your face And go blud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle Ud-dle-um-dum Pick up the soap Now don't try to bluff Work up a lather An' when ya got enough Get your hands full of water Ya snort and ya snuff And go blud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle Ud-dle-um-dum Ya douse and douse Ya scrub and scrub Ya sputter and splash all over the tub You may be cold and wet when your done But ya gotta admit it's good clean fun So splash all ya like It ain't any trick As soon as your through You'll feel mighty slick Grumpy: Bunch of old nanny goats Ya make me sick, goin blud-dle-ud-dlu-ud-dle-ud-dle-um-dum Doc: Now scrub good and hard It can't be denied That he'll look mighty cute As soon as he's dried Dwarfs: Well it's good for the soul And it's good for the hide To go bud-dle-ud-dle-ud-dle Ud-dle-um-dum
