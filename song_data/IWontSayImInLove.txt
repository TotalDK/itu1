If there's a prize for rotten judgement, I guess I've already won that No man is worth the aggravation That's ancient history, been there, done that Who d'you think you're kidding He's the earth and heaven to you Try to keep it hidden, Honey we can see right through you Girl you can't conceal it We know how you're feeling Who you thinking of No chance no way I won't say it, no no (You swoon you sigh why deny it oh oh) It's too cliche I won't say I'm in love I thought my heart had learned its lesson It feels so good when you start out My head is screaming "Get a grip girl Unless you're dying to cry your heart out Girl you can't deny it Who you are is how you're feeling Baby we're not buying Hon we saw you hit the ceiling Face it like a grown-up When you gonna own up that you got got got it bad No chance no way I won't say it, no no (Give up, give in, check the grin you're in love) This scene won't play I won't say I'm in love (We'll do it until you admit you're in love) You're way off base I won't say it Get off my case I won't say it (Girl don't be proud it's okay you're in love) At least out loud I won't say I'm in love
