The manners of the heart We watched them grow Did we write everlasting love, in the Hollywood snow The ribbons and the bows Wrapped us with gold Such pressure heaven knows As the fairy tale folds Who heals the broken ones When love has gone You're not the only ones In an older time when the world was small When good men were standing Reaching out for mother love When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart Never thought I'd see You fallin' away from me Beneath the darker sky The stars are such a mess Can you forward my good-byes To some new address Who heals the broken ones When love has gone You're not the only ones In an older time when the world was small When good men were standing Reaching out for mother love When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart Never thought I'd see You fallin' away from me You can't turn back time We're stranded here Leave the future behind You're not the only ones In an older time when the world was small When good men were standing Reaching out for mother love When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart Never thought I'd see You fallin' away from me
