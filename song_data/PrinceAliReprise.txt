Prince Ali Yes, it is he But not as you know him Read my lips And come to grips With reality Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali! So Ali Turns out to be Merely Aladdin Just a con Need I go on? Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause To send him packing on a one-way trip So his prospects take a terminal dip His assets frozen The venue chosen It's the end of the world, whoopee! So long, ex-prince Ali
