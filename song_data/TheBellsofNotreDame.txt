Morning in Paris, the city awakes To the bells of Notre Dame The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes To the bells of Notre Dame To the big bells as loud as the thunder To the little bells soft as a psalm And some say the soul of the city is The toll of the bells The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies And they gazed up in fear and alarm At a figure whose clutches Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison) Judge Claude Frollo longed To purge the world Of vice and sin (Kyrie Eleison) And he saw corruption Ev'rywhere Except within Dies irae, dies illa (Dies irae, dies illa) Dies irae, dies illa (Dies irae, dies illa) Solvet saeclum in favilla Teste David cum sibylla Quantus tremor est futurus Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions You can claim that you haven't a qualm But you never can run from Nor hide what you've done from the eyes The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison) And for one time in his live Of power and control (Kyrie Eleison) Frollo felt a twinge of fear For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may Yet prove one day to be Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can Sing the bells of Notre Dame Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells Bells, bells, bells, bells Bells of Notre Dame
