Look out for Mr. Stork That persevering chap He'll come along and drop A bundle in your lap You may be poor or rich It doesn't matter which Millionaires, they get theirs Like the butcher and the baker So look out for Mr. Stork And let me tell you, friend Don't try to get away He'll find you in the end He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork So you better look out for Mr. Stork Look out for Mr. Stork He's got you on his list And when he comes around It's useless to resist Remember those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe Maybe he's got his eye on you
