Up, down, up When I up, down and touch the ground It puts me in the mood Up, down and touch the ground In the mood for food I am stout, round and I have found Speaking poundage wise I improve my appetite When I exercise I am short, fat and proud of that And so, with all my might I up, down and up and down To my appetite's delight While I up, down and touch the ground I think of things to chew, like honey With a hefty happy appetite, I'm a hefty happy Pooh With a hefty happy appetite, he's a hefty happy Pooh
