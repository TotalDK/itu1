It's good to see the sun And feel this place This place I never thought would feel like home And I ran forever Far away and I I always thought I'd end up here alone Somehow The world has changed and I've come home To give you back the things they took from you And I feel you now I'm not allone I'll Always know where you are When I see myself I'll always Know where you are Where you are And I found something That was always there Sometimes it's got to hurt before you feel But now I'm strong and I won't kneel Except to thank who's watching over me Somehow I feel so strong and I've begun To be the one I never thought I'd be And I feel you now I'm not alone I'll always know where you are When I see myself I'll always know where you are Where you are Now, it's all so clear and I believe That everything's been opened up to me And I feel you now I'm not alone I always know I always know where you are When I see myself I'll Always know where you are When I feel the sun I'll Always know where you are When I see myself I'll Always know where you are Where you are
