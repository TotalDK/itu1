Now listen up You've got a lot to learn And if you don't learn, you don't eat But if you're tough And always use your head You'll feel right at home on the street When you've got talent ev'rything is free Watch how we do things, ooh, I guarantee You're gonna see how the best survive We make an art out of staying alive If you do just as you're told These are streets of gold Ev'ry boulevard is a miracle mile You'll take the town and you'll take it with style If you play it brave and bold These are streets of gold To live from week to week You need technique So you practice ev'ry day The only rule is: Thou shalt not get caught Get what you can and then get away Remember all the places you can hide Remember we are always on your side You're gonna see how the best survive We make an art out of staying alive If you do just as you're told These are streets of gold Ev'ry boulevard is a miracle mile You'll take the town and you'll take it with style If you play it brave and bold These are streets of gold When you've got talent ev'rything is free Watch how you do things, ooh, I guarantee You're gonna see how the best survive We make an art out of staying alive If you do just as you're told These are streets of gold Ev'ry boulevard is a miracle mile You'll take the town and you'll take it with style If you play it brave and bold These are streets of gold
