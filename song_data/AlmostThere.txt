I don't have time for dancin' That's just gonna have to wait a while Ain't got time for messin' around And it's not my style This whole town can slow you down People takin' the easy way But I know exactly where I am going Gettin closer 'n closer every day And I am almost there I'm almost there People down here think I'm crazy But I don't care Trials and tribulations I've had my share There ain't nothin' gonna stop me now 'Cause I'ma almost there I remember Daddy told me Fairy tales can come true You gotta make 'em happen It all depends on you So I work real hard each and every day Now things for sure are going my way Just doing what I do Look out Boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there I'm almost there People gonna come here from everywhere And I'm almost there I'm almost there There's been trials and tribulations You know I've had my share But I've climbed a mountain I've crossed a river And I'm almost there I'm almost there I'm almost there
