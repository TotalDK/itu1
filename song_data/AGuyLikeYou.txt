Paris, the city of lovers Is glowing this evening True, that's because it's on fire But still, there's l'amour Somewhere out there in the night Her heart is also alight And I know the guy she just might Be burning for A guy like you She's never known, kid A guy like you A girl does not meet every day You've got a look That's all your own, kid Could there be two? Like you? No way! Those other guys That she could dangle All look the same From every boring point of view You're a surprise From every angle Mon Dieu above She's gotta love A guy like you A guy like you Gets extra credit Because it's true You've got a certain something more You're aces, kid You see that face You don't forget it Want something new? That's you For sure! We all have gaped At some Adonis But then we crave a meal More nourishing to chew And since you've shaped Like a croissant is No question of She's gotta love A guy like you! Call me a hopeless romantic But Quasi, I feel it She wants you so Any moment she'll walk through that door For A guy so swell With all you bring her A fool could tell It's why she fell For you-know-who You ring the bell You're the bell ringer! When she wants oo-la-la Then she wants you la-la She will discover, guy You're one heckuva guy Who wouldn't love a guy Like you? You got a lot The rest have not She's gotta love a guy like you!
