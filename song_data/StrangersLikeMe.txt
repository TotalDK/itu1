Whatever you do I'll do it too Show me everything And tell me how You know me something And yet nothing to me I can see there is too much to learn It's all so close And yet so far I see myself As people see me But I just know there's something bigger out there I want to know, can you show me I want to know about the strangers like me Tell me more, please show me Something's familiar About the strangers like me Every gesture Every move that she makes Makes me feel like never before Why do I have this growing need to be beside her There are some emotions that I never knew Some for the world far beyond this place Beyond the trees, above the clouds I see before me a new horizon I want to know, can you show me? I want to know about the strangers like me Tell me more, please show me Something is familiar About the strangers like me Come with me now To see my world Where there's beauty beyond your dreams Can you feel the things I feel right now with you Take my hand There's a world I need to know I want to know, can you show me? I want to know about the strangers like me Tell me more, please show me Something is familiar About the strangers like me I want to know
