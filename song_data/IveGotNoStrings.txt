I've got no strings To hold me down To make me fret Or make me frown I had strings But now I'm free There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o That's the only way to go I want the world to know Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings So I have fun I'm not tied up to anyone They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me You have no strings Your arms is free To love me by the Zuider Zee Ya, ya, ya If you would woo I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings Comme ci comme ca Your savoire-faire is ooh la la I've got strings But entre nous I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows There's a Russian rendezvous Where me and Ivan go But I'd rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me
