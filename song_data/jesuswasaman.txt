Jesus was a man He was better than you or I They didn't tell him No, they didn't tell him You didn't know Hitler was a man He didn't know what to do anymore Everybody said someone else But we know that's a lie Yeah, Gandhi was a man He took the millions and gave them more We all adore I said it long ago Where the situation screams so true All of it was long ago in humanity So climb out of the cradle And show yourself to the rest of humanity Cause I told you long ago even though you knew yourself And all you thought was true, So true, Too true... Pieces of you Little pieces, little pieces of you Oh, little pieces of me and you Jesus was a man He was better than you or I No one told him, no one knew Hitler was a man You know it In humanity to man Pieces of you Little pieces of me and you Ohhh, little pieces of me and you Ohhh, oh oh oh My guitar doesn't work and I wanna play a lead solo!
