Don't talk to me about ban the bomb Don't ask me what side I'm on Replace the system with one just the same Don't you realise we are all to blame It's so easy as an armchair blamer Get off your seat and make a personal change sir Can't change the system without smashing it down Inside route personal revolution Change the man Change the man Rip out the root Lets get rid of this insanity When the mothers had told the kids straight When the fathers felt no more hate inside When a man walks down the street without fear Then things must change whoa whoa And it's not too late to Change the man Change the man
