Just whistle while you work And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place So hum a merry tune It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace And as you sweep the room Imagine that the broom Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune When hearts are high the time will fly so whistle while you work
