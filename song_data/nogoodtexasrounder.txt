Excuse me, ma'am I'd like your daughter's hand for the evening There's a new band in town I'd like to take her down to see 'em. The fiddler player used to be my neighbor And he never slept a day in his life He plays the 'Strawberry Roan' When he gets going he can play all night. And her mama said: He's a no good Texas cowboy, child He'll love you up and he'll drive you wild Then he'll leave you He's a no good Texas rounder, girl Got a one-track mind And he ain't on true love and that's for sure She said I've met his kind before I've met your kind before. Excuse me, ma'am I'd like your daughter's hand for the evening My intentions are good, I'm a man of honor Please, ignore any rumors that have blackened my name I'm just an innocent boy, How could I be to blame? We'll be late for the show And I took her hand and said let's go. And her mama said: He's a no good Texas cowboy, child He'll love you up and he'll drive you wild Then he'll leave you He's a no good Texas rounder, girl Got a one-track mind And he ain't on true love and that's for sure She said I've met his kind before I've met your kind before. Excuse me, ma'am I'd like your daughter's hand for the evening I think you know the band I'd like to take her down to see 'em I'd been led to understand the fiddler was your man That's why he never slept a day in his life He plays the 'Strawberry Roan' Just to get you going then you play all night. And the daughter said: He was a no good Texas Texas cowboy, child He'll love you up and he'll drive you wild Then he'll leave you He's a no good Texas rounder, girl Got a one-track mind And he ain't on true love and that's for sure She said I've met his kind before I've met your kind before...
