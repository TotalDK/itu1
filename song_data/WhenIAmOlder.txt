What was that? Samantha? This will all make sense when I am older Someday I will see that this makes sense One day, when I'm old and wise I'll think back and realize That these were all completely normal events I'll have all the answers when I'm older Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood I know in a couple years These will seem like childish fears So I know this isn't bad, it's good Excuse me Growing up means adapting Puzzling at your world and your place When I'm more mature I'll feel totally secure Being watched by something with a creepy, creepy face See, that will all make sense when I am older So there's no need to be terrified or tense I'll just dream about a time When I'm in my aged prime 'Cause when you're older Absolutely everything makes sense This is fine
