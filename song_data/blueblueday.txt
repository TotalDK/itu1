It's been a blue, blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from it all My love has been untrue She's found somebody new It's been a blue, blue day for me Well I feel like crying, dying What can I do I feel like praying, saying I'm glad we're through It's been a blue, blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from the blues Yes how can I make believe That I don't sit and grieve It's been a blue, blue day for me I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway It's been a blue blue day for me Well I feel like crying... I feel like runnin' away from the blues
