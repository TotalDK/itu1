Grady johnson was a common man Four children and some bottom land Early to bed he said well that ain't me I gotta spend some time with my family Left to it's own device may becomes june But children grow up all too soon So love your neighbor as yourself Don't use money to measure wealth Trust in God but lock your door Buy low sell high and slow dance more Mama johnson was grady's wife She bore his children and she graced his life Hand in hand and side by side They worked hard to simplify Some folks have and some have not What really counts is what you do with what you've got So love your neighbor as yourself Don't use money to measure wealth Trust in God but lock your door Buy low sell high and slow dance more And more I think I understan What my father's father meant When he said son what matters most You can count on just one hand So love your neighbor as yourself Don't use money to measure wealth Trust in God but lock your door Buy low sell high and slow dance more Buy low sell high and slow dance more
